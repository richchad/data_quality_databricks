# metadata_driven_sql
Examples of metadata driven SQL processes implemented in Databricks.

This repository contains notebooks to demonstrate metadata driven SQL processes that can be implemented in Databricks, it includes a DBC and html version of each notebook.

The SQL processes detailed in this repository are related to data quality and data product management. 
They include methods for automating the managment of a data dictionary, refining a data model (comments and column positions), executing data quality tests and filtering bad quality data.

### Notebooks
1. Create sample data using Databricks data sets.
2. Create dictionary tables.
3. Land metastore data and persist in dictionary.
4. Refine data model.
5. Configuring data quality tests.
6. Executing data quality tests.
7. Filtering data base on data quality results.
8. Applying mappings.
9. Clean up (drop all created tables from demo).
